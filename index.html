        <p>
            My name is <b>Steven Beckham</b> and I am a self-learning software engineer.
            This is my first attempt at creating a website!
            I created this project in order to pratice HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            This is also a good opportunity to practice Git in conjunction with Github for future collaborative projects!
